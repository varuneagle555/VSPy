# C-Munipcak Project

The [C-Munipack Project](http://c-munipack.sourceforge.net/) is the software package, which offers the complete solution for reduction of images carried out by CCD camera, intended on a observation of variable stars.

## Why?
This Project is part of the Astronomy Research Class at Phillips Academy Andover. The purpose of this project is to develop a system that would allow users to easily discover and identify existing and new variable stars in a given set of images.

## Retrieving Data for Light Curves
* Calibrate Images
* Import into Muniwin
    * Predefined - Light Curve
    * Add Frames from Folder
* Settings
    * Star Detection
        * FWHM = 6.50
    * Matching = Globular CLusters
* Express Reduction
    * Convert Files
    * Photometry
* Matching
    * Select Reference frame with most stars
**Before continuing, look through images and delete irregularities**

* Find Variables
    * Aperature - #4 (5.27)
    * Add Comp Stars
    * Export Varfind Data
