  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Finish Data Parser. The objective of the data parser is to parse the export data of Munipack and store the light curves in VSDB.
Complete Light Curve Plotting Capabilities in Lightcurve.ipnyb in complement of Data Parser to show results of both.
Complete basic interface of VSDB, including adding sets and stars of sets to DB.
Complete 5 Munipack Projects of 5 stacks of NGC2180 images by exporting varfind data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Complete VSDB Interface, allowing User to store light curves of all stars of an image stack as well as retrieve all light curves of a given star.
Complete Periodogram Functionality and Comparison Star comparison functionality in Lightcurve.ipnyb
Finish all Munipack Projects for all image sets in NGC2180</td>
